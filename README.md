# CodePlex-Software-complexity-measuring-tool
A software complexity measuring tool developed based on WCC(Weighted Composite complexity) Measure by Chihhlar and Bhasins. 
This Project is developed using PHP.
This project calculate the complexity by following software metricss
1. Inheritence Level
2. Nesting Level
3. Control structure
4. Size

Additionally this project also introduce following features.
1. Multiple inheritence
2. Compound conditional statements
3. Array and Object Declarations
4. Methods with multiple statements
